I am in my third year of graduate studies and am a Berkeley fellow. I am currently a Graduate Student Researcher in the [Berkeley D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/home) under Professor David Harding. This research focuses on improving outcomes for underrepresented students in STEM using Berkeley's Data Science program as a case study.
