I am a Berkeley Fellow and a third year PhD student in the department of Sociology at [University of California, Berkeley](https://sociology.berkeley.edu/graduate-student/jacqueline-brown). I am a mixed-methodologist who is interested in access to higher education, organizational change, and socioeconomic mobility. I have experience in quantitative, computational, interview, and case study methods.
